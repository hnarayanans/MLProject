## 📖 Project Description

The Cognitive Memory Analytics System is a full-stack web application that simulates and visualizes how human memory decays over time using the **Ebbinghaus forgetting curve**. Users upload PDF study materials, take AI-generated quizzes, and watch their personalized retention curves update in real time.

Unlike static flashcard tools, this system uses log-linear regression to **learn each user's personal decay rate (λ)** from their quiz history — making predictions progressively more accurate the more they study. A built-in time simulator lets users fast-forward days without waiting, enabling rapid experimentation and analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- HTML5 / CSS3 
- Jinja2 Templating
- Vanilla JavaScript (Canvas API — no external chart libraries)

**Backend**
- Python 3 / Flask
- SQLite (via `memory.db`, auto-created on first run)
- Werkzeug (password hashing)

**AI / ML**
- Groq API (`openai/gpt-oss-120b`) — LLM quiz generation
- Custom log-linear regression for λ (decay rate) learning
- Piecewise exponential forgetting curve: `R(t) = R₀ · exp(-λ · Δt)`

**DevOps & Tools**
- Git & GitHub
- pip / requirements.txt

## ✨ Features

1. **Personalized Forgetting Curves** — Visualizes memory retention over time using a piecewise exponential model `R(t) = R₀ · exp(-λ · Δt)`. Each quiz attempt creates a new decay segment, producing a graph with visible "jumps" on re-study.

2. **ML-Learned Decay Parameters** — Uses log-linear regression on consecutive quiz attempts to learn each user's personal decay rate (λ) and retention boost (R₀). Falls back gracefully to λ=0.1 with fewer than 2 attempts.

3. **AI-Powered Quiz Generation** — Integrates with Groq's LLM API to auto-generate 5 multiple-choice questions directly from uploaded PDF content, with no manual question writing needed.

4. **PDF Upload & Text Extraction** — Users upload study materials as PDFs. The system extracts text via `pypdf` and stores it for on-demand quiz generation tied to each topic.

5. **Simulated Time Progression** — A UI slider (0–90 days) lets users advance simulated time without real waiting, enabling rapid testing of memory decay across different study schedules.

6. **Secure Multi-User Auth** — Session-based authentication with `pbkdf2:sha256` password hashing. All data is strictly scoped per user — no cross-user data leakage.

> The system follows a clean service-layer architecture. Routes handle HTTP only; all business logic lives in `services/`. The forgetting curve, ML learning, and LLM quiz generation are fully decoupled into independent services.

## ⚙️ Installation

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+, pip, and a free [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com).

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tinkherhacktrauma.git
cd tinkherhacktrauma
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Set environment variables**
```bash
# Required — get a free key at https://console.groq.com
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Optional — Flask session secret (defaults to dev key)
export SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

> On Windows, use `set GROQ_API_KEY=...` instead of `export`.

---

## ▶️ Run Commands

**Start the app**
```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` — the SQLite database (`memory.db`) is created automatically on first run.

> ⚠️ **Offline mode is NOT supported.** Quiz generation requires a live Groq API connection. The system will fail with a descriptive error rather than silently degrade if the API is unavailable.

## 📐 Core Concepts

**Forgetting Curve (Piecewise Exponential)**

Each quiz attempt creates a new decay segment. Old segments are never modified — reattempts close the previous segment and open a new one, creating visible "jumps" in the graph:

```
R(t) = R₀ · exp(-λ · (t - t₀))
```

- `t₀` = time of the quiz attempt (simulated days)
- `R₀` = initial retention = quiz score (minimum 0.2)
- `λ` = decay rate (baseline: 0.1; personalized via ML)

**Machine Learning (Explainable, Lightweight)**

λ is learned using log-linear regression on consecutive attempt pairs:

```
λ = -log(score_next / score_prev) / Δt
```

Final λ = mean of all valid estimates. Falls back to λ=0.1 with fewer than 2 attempts. R₀ boost is tracked as an exponential moving average of score improvements.
